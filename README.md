# React Scroll Sensor

A lightweight scroll sensor to solve your react scroll into viewport issues.

 > TLDR; An unopinionated sensor to detect when your component gets into the viewport and injects the intersection info into your component.

 If you ever have tried to implement the support necessary to detect when your components get into the viewport when scrolling, you know how much it hurts. That's the exact reason this library is here.
 Whether you want to use scroll event-based tracking or intersection observer-based tracking, it's already packed into this sensor.

## Installing


```console
yarn add react-scrollsense
